Hey, I built another blog -- written in English.

While I'm relatively fluent Japanese speaker(jk I'm native speaker but Japanese is such difficult language, I don't think myself as perfect Japanese speaker), however majority of the web developer world is written in English. I'm not good at write down some my thoughts in English, thought worth it to trying some.

## How I built this place?

I'm familiar with [Astro](https://astro.build/), really good tool to build such content-focused website so it was no-brainer.

Source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/lonsagisawa/lonsagisawa.github.io) and utilise recent Content Collections from Astro v2 and going well so far. Not quite simple as file-based routing so definitely recommended to stick with it for beginners, but if you are familiar with some website building with headless CMS it's quite easy.

Deploy side, I'm quite familiar with Vercel, no complaints for them, still my go-to choice(especially for Next.js project). However, I don't have any experience with GitHub Actions, and my GitHub Pages was empty, so decided to try this.

Astro has [good tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) for deploying such combination, and it just worked. I'm still trying to figure out what that sample `yml` doing.
